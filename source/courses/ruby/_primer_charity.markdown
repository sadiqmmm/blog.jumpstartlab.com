In this short class we'll introduce the Ruby language and the most basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.

We'll work through the "Ruby in 100 Minutes" tutorial, a hands on exploration of the language's fundamentals.  You'll need a laptop with Ruby installed, check out our instructions here: [Setting up Ruby](/resources/general/environment/)

This session is built for *non-programmers*.  An interest in programming is all you need to join us.  If you are an existing programmer, though, you can still enjoy an exposure to Ruby and there are plenty of opportunities to freestyle on your own.

All proceeds from this workshop will benefit [DonorsChoose](http://donorschoose.org), a charity that connects donors directly with classrooms in need.  Helping kids is great, and you get *awesome* thank you notes!

Also, check out their just-launched [Hacking Education](http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education) API/Data contest with categories for Ruby, JavaScript, Data Visualization, and more!
