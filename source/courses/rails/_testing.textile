In the Ruby world, testing is a religion.  There are many who preach "TATFT" and we know that tested code is more reliable code.

If you aren't yet a testing guru, this workshop is for you.  With a team of awesome instructors and a loaded day of hands-on practice, you'll learn the fundamentals of...

* Unit Testing your Ruby with RSpec and Test::Unit
* Driving the browser with Selenium
* Headless integration testing with Capybara
* Behavior Driven Development with Cucumber
* Writing robust tests
* Measuring test coverage and efficiency
* Test-First versus Test-Driven

We'll work with a sample application built in Ruby on Rails, but the techniques we study are not at all tied to Rails.  They're applicable to other Ruby code and the concepts apply to even other languages and frameworks.

h3. All for Charity

The whole workshop is setup to benefit "DonorsChoose":http://www.donorschoose.org/.  They're an awesome charity that connects teachers across the US with donors who sponsor their projects and students.  When Jeff taught high school he had a grant funded through "DonorsChoose":http://www.donorschoose.org/ and it totally changed the students' experience.  There's very little overhead and few hoops to jump through; "DonorsChoose":http://www.donorschoose.org/ just does an awesome job of connecting teachers and donors.

"DonorsChoose":http://www.donorschoose.org/ has setup a matching fund, so your impact will even be doubled!  Tickets for the event are $350, $50 goes towards costs, and you'll get a $600 credit to donate on the website at the end of the workshop.  How awesome is that?

h3. Who Should Attend

You need to be comfortable writing Ruby and working with a Rails application.  If you've got a few months of experience with Rails, then you're set.  If you're brand new to Ruby or Rails, this probably won't be a good fit.
