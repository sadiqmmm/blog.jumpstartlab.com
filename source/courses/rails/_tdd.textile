You’ve written a Rails project or worked through a book. You’ve got a feeling for the whole MVC thing and why Rails is so great — now what?

This special edition TDD/Rails3 primer pushes you the next step forward. You already know about the simple features; this class focuses on what you need for real projects. We’ll dip into Test Driven Development, explore new features of Rails 3, work with advanced data models, break up code into reusable parts, and try some awesome 3rd party libraries and tools. All course content course is updated to take advantage of the new features in Rails 3.

We'll create a sample project that illustrates these needs, a contact manager application featuring:

* Guiding development with TDD and RSpec
* Model structures using “has many through” and single table inheritance
* Using helpers and partials to clean up duplication
* Advanced views with HAML and SASS
* Easy form creation with Formtastic
* Pushing logic into the model layer
* Writing custom routes to simplify development
