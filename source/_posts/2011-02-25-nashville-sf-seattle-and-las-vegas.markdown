The past week has been busy. &nbsp;On Thursday I presented an updated version of "Fat Model's Aren't Enough" to the <a title="Nashville Ruby User Group" target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/nashvillerails/">Nashville Ruby User Group</a>. &nbsp;There were about 30 developers that came out, a great group! &nbsp;While in town I was surprised to see my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a> who, along with partner <a title="Eliza Brock" target="_blank" href="http://elizabrock.com/">Eliza Brock</a>, has a new startup named <a target="_blank" href="http://rightbonus.com/">RightBonus</a>. &nbsp;Look for it to launch this spring.

Then it was on to San Francisco where I taught a free <a target="_blank" href="http://jumpstartlab.com/courses/ruby">Ruby Primer</a> in the classroom at <a target="_blank" href="http://blazingcloud.net/">Blazing Cloud</a>. &nbsp;They are teaching some awesome classes there, definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. &nbsp;

Saturday and Sunday I taught <a target="_blank" href="http://jumpstartlab.com/courses/rails">Rails Jumpstart: Level 1</a> to a small group over at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> office. &nbsp;It was a great class and we enjoyed hanging out in the space, especially when I (finally) got to play some RockBand.

Monday if was off to Seattle for another <a target="_blank" href="http://jumpstartlab.com/courses/ruby">Ruby Primer</a> hosted by our friends at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluebox.net/">Blue Box Group</a>. &nbsp;The turnout was great; we had trouble fitting everyone in.

Then Wednesday I headed for Las Vegas and presented "Fat Models Aren't Enough" to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/las-vegas-ruby-on-rails/">Las Vegas Ruby Users Group</a>. &nbsp;I've been to the LVRUG twice now, and they're a really small but extremely friendly group. &nbsp;They meet twice a month, so whenever I'm in town I try to stop by.

The world tour continues!
